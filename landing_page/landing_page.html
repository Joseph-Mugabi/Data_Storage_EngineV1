							 <h2 class="card-title">User</h2>
							 <p class="card-description">The user model in a data storage engine represents a user object and 
								contains information about the user such as their email, password, first name, last name, location,
								contact information, and a unique identifier for the user.

								The user model is used to store and retrieve user information from the data storage engine.
								It is responsible for creating new user objects, updating existing user information,
								and deleting user accounts. The user model is also responsible for enforcing data
								validation rules such as email address format and password length.
								
								The user model is typically used in conjunction with other two models i.e. Data and Settings models in the data storage
								engine to establish relationships between users and other objects in the system.
								For example, a user may have a one-to-many relationship with data objects,
								meaning that a user can create multiple data objects, but each data object can
								only be associated with one user. </p>

							 <h2 class="card-title">Settings</h2>
							 <p class="card-description">The Settings model represents user settings for the data storage engine.
								It is used to store and retrieve user-specific settings,  and allows users to customize their
								preferences in the application. This includes selecting their preferred theme, language, 
								and notification settings.</p>

					 <h2>About Us</h2>
					 <p>Welcome to the Data Storage Engine, we're here to store and support
					 your future, wherever you need store and keep consistence of your Files
					for tomorrow use, start with us your journey.</p> 
					<p>Data storage engine is designed to support technology solutions, through providing a way to store and retrieve data in 
					a structured format and it serves as a cental repository for data, which can be
					accessed by multiple applications and services.</p>
					<p>The Engine provides several benefits to user's data i.e. 
						Data structure and organization, Data consistency, Data availability for all authorized users
						regardless of your location and Data security measures to protect sensitive data.
					</i></p>
					 <p>Challenges</p
					 <p>The performance of the data storage engine, can impact the user experience. Yet there is need to
						optimize the engine's performance to ensure fast response times and minimal latency.</p>
					 <p>The data storage engine may need to interact with other systems or applications.
						So an API is designed to ensure that the engine is interoperable with other systems
						and can exchange data seamlessly.</p>
						<p>There are other challenges include:- scalability, Security, Maintenance
							and Updates, and User experience.
